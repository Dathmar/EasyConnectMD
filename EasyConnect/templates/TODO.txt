Update 01.07
Connect form:
- Make sure you are happy with spacing.  I think it's fine
- Birthday text box should be a bit longer to compensate for the datepicker icon.
- Gender options should be horizontal
- Terms I think the alignment is a little off now that it's in the form.
- Probably my issue, but button should have some text in it.
